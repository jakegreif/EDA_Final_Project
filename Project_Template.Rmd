# Research Question and Rationale

<Paragraph detailing the rationale for your analysis. What is the significant application and/or interest in this topic? Connect to environmental topic(s)/challenge(s).>

Across the country, the expected effects of climate change are being
realized in the form of more intense precipitation events and dry
periods. In North Texas, the city of Dallas is familiar with intense
storms as it resides in a portion of the country where warm air from 
the Gulf of Mexico and cool air flowing down from the Rocky Mountains 
converge, producing dramatic storms. Though, the city is also 
accustomed to dry spells, particularly in the summer. Despite the 
famaliarity this region has with both hydrologic extremes, it has 
experienced particularly intense events in recent years. Therefore, 
this project will examine trends in the flow of the Trinity River 
and a tributary of the Trinity River near Dallas, TX. In particular,
the analysis will attempt to determine if extreme flow rates have 
become more prevalent in recent decades compared to discharges over
the past centry.

<Paragraph detailing your research question(s) and goals. What do you want to find out? Include a sentence (or a few) on the dataset you are using to answer this question - just enough to give your reader an idea of where you are going with the analysis.>

Have extreme discharge events become more frequent in the Dallas area?
How do the frequency of extreme discharge events in higher and lower 
order streams in the area compare? To answer this question, data from 
both USGS site 08057000 on the Trinity river in Dallas, TX and USGS 
site 08049500 on the West Fork Trinity River in Grand Prairie, TX will 
be analyzed. Specifically, the mean daily discharge at both sites will 
be characterized based on the frequency of occurance. As per USGS 
percentile thresholds, a discharge that falls above the 75th percentile
is considered to be above normal, and a discharge that falls below the 
25th percentile is considered below normal. Therefore, in the context 
of this analysis, a discharge above the 75th percentile is considered 
a "flood", and a discharge below the 25th percentile is considered a 
"drought." The goal of this analysis is to determine if recent extreme 
events are indicative of an emerging trend, as well as if...

# Dataset Information

<Information on how the dataset for this analysis were collected, the data contained in the dataset, and any important pieces of information that are relevant to your analyses. This section should contain much of same information as the README file for the dataset but formatted in a way that is more narrative.>



<Add a table that summarizes your data structure. This table can be made in markdown text or inserted as a `kable` function in an R chunk. If the latter, do not include the code used to generate your table.>

# Exploratory Data Analysis and Wrangling

<Include R chunks for 5+ lines of summary code (display code and output), 3+ exploratory graphs (display graphs only), and any wrangling you do to your dataset(s).>
