# Research Question and Rationale

<Paragraph detailing the rationale for your analysis. What is the significant application and/or interest in this topic? Connect to environmental topic(s)/challenge(s).>

Across the country, the expected effects of climate change are being
realized in the form of more intense precipitation events and dry
periods. In North Texas, the city of Dallas is familiar with intense
storms as it resides in a portion of the country where warm air from 
the Gulf of Mexico and cool air flowing down from the Rocky Mountains 
converge, producing dramatic storms. Though, the city is also 
accustomed to dry spells, particularly in the summer. Despite the 
famaliarity this region has with both hydrologic extremes, it has 
experienced particularly intense events in recent years. Therefore, 
this project will examine trends in the flow of the Trinity River 
and a tributary of the Trinity River near Dallas, TX. In particular,
the analysis will attempt to determine if extreme flow rates have 
become more prevalent in recent decades compared to discharges over
the past centry.

<Paragraph detailing your research question(s) and goals. What do you want to find out? Include a sentence (or a few) on the dataset you are using to answer this question - just enough to give your reader an idea of where you are going with the analysis.>

Have extreme discharge events become more frequent in the Dallas area?
How do the frequency of extreme discharge events in higher and lower 
order streams in the area compare? To answer this question, data from 
both USGS site 08057000 on the Trinity river in Dallas, TX and USGS 
site 08049500 on the West Fork Trinity River in Grand Prairie, TX will 
be analyzed. Specifically, the mean daily discharge at both sites will 
be characterized based on the frequency of occurance. As per USGS 
percentile thresholds, a discharge that falls above the 75th percentile
is considered to be above normal, and a discharge that falls below the 
25th percentile is considered below normal. Therefore, in the context 
of this analysis, a discharge above the 75th percentile is considered 
a "flood", and a discharge below the 25th percentile is considered a 
"drought." The goal of this analysis is to determine if recent extreme 
events are indicative of an emerging trend, as well as if a larger,
more regulated river (i.e.the Trinity River) has less frequent extreme
discharge than a lower order tributary.

# Dataset Information

<Information on how the dataset for this analysis were collected, the data contained in the dataset, and any important pieces of information that are relevant to your analyses. This section should contain much of same information as the README file for the dataset but formatted in a way that is more narrative.>

The dataset used in the analysis was sourced from the U.S. Geological
Survey's (USGS) Water Data website. While there is a collection of
physical and chemical data available, the only data used for this
analysis is average daily discharge (ft^3/s). The gauge sites used in
the analysis were found using an interactive map on the USGS Water Data
website, and were selected based on their proximity to the city of
Dallas. The West Fork Trinity River was chosen as the representative
tributary due the lack of development surrounding the river, as well as
the lack of river control present upstream. After idenifying the gauge
station number at both locations, the number was entered into the
'Site Number' search bar. Then, the 'Discharge' check-box was selected
and the years 1925-2019 were selected. 1925 was chosen as the start
date based on the earliest available data for both datasets. Both
datasets also contain maximum and minimum daily discharge, however that
data is only available beginning in 1989 for the Trinity River, and in
2001 for the West Fork Trinity River. Therefore, using the average
daily discharge allowed the analysis to encompass a larger timeframe.

# Summary and Conclusions
<Summarize your major findings from your analyses. What conclusions do you draw from your findings? Make sure to apply this to a broader application for the research question you have answered.>

The discharge of rivers in the Dallas area show that the region is
getting wetter over time. In both the Trinity River and the West Fork
Trinity River, "droughts" have become less frequent, while "floods"
have become more frequent. However, even though the Mann-Kendall tests
revealed that these trends are indeed monotonic, none of the trends are
particularlly strong. The strongest correlation between extreme
discharge frequency and time were "drought" discharge conditions in the
West Fork Trinity River, which can be characterized as a moderately
strong negative trend based on the results of the Man-Kendall test
(z = -5.75). The other Man-Kendall tests produced absolute z values no
greater than 2.35, indiicating that while the trends are monotonic,
they are relatively weak trends. 

Pettitt's test was used to determine if any change points exist within
the data. A change point is where the magnitude or direction of the
trend changes in the data. The analysis found that in both rivers, a
change point in "flood" discharges occurred in the 1980s, and the
change point in the "drought" discharges occurred in 1964. The only
significant trends before or after the change point were found in
the "drought" datasets for both rivers, which experienced negative
trends after 1964. Meaning, both the Trinity River and the West Fork
Trinity River experienced less frequent "drought" discharges after
1964. 

The results of this analysis indicate that the Trinity River and it's
tributary, the West Fork Trinity River, are experiencing similar trends
in the frequency of extreme hydrologic events. However, the trends in
the larger Trinity River are weaker overall than the West Fork Trinity
River, particularlly in "drought" discharge frequency. Maintaing
minimum flows in the Trinity River is much more important than
controling flows in the West Fork Trinity River, considering the
Trinity River is the largest river in the area and is used as a source
of drinking water. The analysis confirms that recent extreme events in
the Dallas area are indicative of an emerging trend. It also confirms
that extreme discharge trends in a larger, more regulated river like
the Trinity River are less intense than a lower order tributary.
